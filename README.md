- 👋 Hi, we are the @VeganAfricaFund
- 👀 Our [mission](https://pitch.vaf.one) is to support high-growth-potential African-owned vegan companies, with a long-term vision of forming an investment DAO. The fund is supported through token sales from [VAF](https://vaf.one) and NFT sales through the [Astral Giraffes](https://opensea.io/collection/astral-giraffes).
- 🌱 We are currently growing our community on [Discord](https://discord.gg/NWY6Qvg4fH), [Twitter](https://twitter.com/veganafricafund), and [Instagram](https://instagram.com/veganafricafund). We'd love for you to get involved!
- 💞️ Collaboration is key to a thriving ecosystem. We are looking to collaborate on Dapp development, specifically staking VAF tokens on our [website](https://veganafricafund.com). We are also looking for token buyers, NFT collectors, and aligned community members!
- 📫 The best way to reach us is through email - hello@veganafricafund.com or reach our founder through sunny@vaf.one
